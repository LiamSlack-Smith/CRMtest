# Git Repository Information

This directory is managed by Git.

The version control data is stored in the hidden '.git' subdirectory.

Common commands:
  git status          # Check the status of your files
  git add <file>      # Stage a file for commit
  git add .           # Stage all changes
  git commit -m "msg" # Commit staged changes with a message
  git log             # View commit history

This file (.git_repo_info.txt) was automatically generated by the IDE
during repository initialization. You can safely ignore or delete it.
